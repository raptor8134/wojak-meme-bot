# wojak-meme-bot
Reddit bot that makes wojak memes from text so r/politicalcompassmemes users can insult each other.

The preliminary version is currently testing on r/wojakmemebot

## TODO
* Improve current logging
* Deploy using Heroku
* Improve implementation of chadyes and chadno (right now it's just copy-pasted)
* Improve the ascii renderer
* Clean up code in general
* Add more templates
* Get all environ/getenv out of bot classes and have tokens passed in as arguments
