# wojak-meme-bot
Reddit bot that makes wojak memes from text so r/politicalcompassmemes users can insult each other.

The preliminary version is currently testing on r/wojakmemebot

## TODO
* Add proper logging
* Async reddit
* Re-allow multiple subreddits at once
* Deploy using Heroku
* Improve implementation of chadyes and chadno (right now it's just copy-pasted)
* Clean up code in general
