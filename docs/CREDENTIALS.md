# Credentials

## Key names and usage

For reference, a list of all the app tokens and api keys and where they are used. I use a .env file to store them, and `load_dotenv()` with `environ["TOKEN"]` to access them in python.

```bash
I_CLIENT_ID="client_id"         # Imgur client id
I_CLIENT_SECRET="secret"        # Imgur secret/token

R_USER_AGENT="python3-praw"     # Tells reddit you use PRAW
R_CLIENT_ID="client_id"         # Reddit client id
R_CLIENT_SECRET="secret"        # Reddit client secret
R_USERNAME="wojak-meme-bot"     # The bot's username
R_PASSWORD="password123"        # Password for the bot's account
R_SUBREDDITS="memes all"        # List of subreddits to reply in seperated by spaces

D_TOKEN="token"                 # Discord token
D_CLIENT_ID="client_id"         # Discord client id
D_PERMISSIONS="309237681152"    # Permissions integer generated by the Discord api website, you can use this one or make your own
```

## Testing without production keys

If you do want to contribute but need to test something that would require running the bot in a live environment, either run your own instance (instructions below) or create a new PR/branch and I can test it.

## Running your own instance

Instructions for getting your own Imgur, Reddit, and Discord keys/tokens below, keep the rate limits and terms in mind while using them.
